## üí∞ Paid Version Candidates

Features that provide significant value but are out of scope for core grep functionality.

### 1. Find & Replace

**Impact**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Highest - heavily requested)
**Effort**: üî®üî®üî®üî®üî® (20-40 hours)
**Status**: **OUT OF SCOPE** for core free version (grep is read-only)
**Paid Version**: **HIGH PRIORITY** feature differentiator

**Why Out of Core Scope**:
- Grep is fundamentally a search/read-only tool
- Write access adds complexity and risk
- File modification requires careful safety features

**Why Good for Paid Version**:
- Heavily requested by users (multiple reviews in Russian, English)
- Clear value proposition: "aGrep Pro - Search AND Replace"
- Justifies premium pricing (powerful feature)
- Power user feature (fits technical audience)

**Requirements**:

**Phase 1: Preview Mode**
- Add "Replace" tab in main UI
- "Replace with" text field
- Preview changes before applying (show before/after)
- Display count of matches that will be replaced

- Replace only in selected line ranges
- Case-preserving replace (replace "hello" ‚Üí "HELLO" becomes "world" ‚Üí "WORLD")
- Audit log of all replacements

**Technical Challenges**:
- File encoding handling (read in one encoding, write in same)
- Large file handling (can't load entire file into memory)
- Atomic file updates (don't corrupt on failure)
- Permission handling (write access to selected directories)
- Backup storage management

## üî¨ Research & Long-Term Projects

Features that are technically interesting and valuable but require significant R&D.

### 3. Fuzzy Search / Character Normalization

**Impact**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Medium-High if done well)
**Effort**: üî®üî®üî®üî® (10-20 hours)
**Status**: **RESEARCH** - Interesting technical challenge
**Paid Version**: Possible differentiator

**What**: Generalized fuzzy matching system (NOT language-specific)

**Original Request**:
- Japanese users requested: full-width ‚ü∑ half-width kana, new kanji ‚ü∑ old kanji
- But this should be generalized, not Japanese-only

**Generalized Approach**:

1. **Character Equivalence Rules**
   - Define custom equivalence classes: `a ‚âà √° ‚âà √† ‚âà √¢ ‚âà √§` (accents)
   - Unicode normalization: NFD, NFC, NFKD, NFKC
   - Case folding beyond simple toLowerCase()
   - Width normalization: full-width ‚ü∑ half-width

2. **Edit Distance Fuzzy Matching**
   - Levenshtein distance: allow N character differences
   - Damerau-Levenshtein: allow transpositions
   - Configure tolerance: exact, 1 char off, 2 chars off

3. **Configurable Fuzzy Rules**
   - User-defined equivalence files: `config/fuzzy_rules.txt`
   - Format: `group: a,√°,√†,√¢,√§,A,√Å,√Ä,√Ç,√Ñ`
   - Language-specific rules as optional plugins

**Use Cases**:
- **European languages**: Accented characters (caf√© ‚âà cafe)
- **Japanese**: Kana width, kanji variants
- **Typo tolerance**: "teh" finds "the"
- **OCR errors**: Common character misrecognition

**Technical Challenges**:
- Performance: Fuzzy matching is expensive
- False positives: Too fuzzy = irrelevant results
- UI/UX: How to communicate fuzzy matches to user?
- Configuration: Balance power vs. complexity

**Research Questions**:
1. Can we use finite automata for efficient fuzzy matching?
2. How to visualize/highlight fuzzy matches in results?
3. Should fuzzy rules be per-search or global preference?
4. How to handle fuzzy matching with regex?

**Potential Libraries/Algorithms**:
- Apache Commons Text: Levenshtein distance
- ICU4J: Unicode normalization, transliteration
- Lucene: Fuzzy query algorithms
- Custom: Build equivalence-class NFA

**Why Interesting**:
- Cross-linguistic text processing
- Algorithm design (efficient fuzzy matching)
- Balancing power vs. usability
- Could be published as separate library

**Monetization Potential**:
- Free: Basic fuzzy (typo tolerance)
- Paid: Advanced fuzzy rules, language-specific plugins

### 4. Performance Profiling & Optimization Deep Dive

**Impact**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Highest - affects all searches)
**Effort**: üî®üî®üî®üî® (10-15 hours for comprehensive analysis)
**Status**: **IMPORTANT** - Should be done for free version quality

**Implementation Plan**: See `docs/SAF_SEARCH_PERFORMANCE_PLAN.md` for detailed methodology

**What**: Systematic performance analysis and optimization

**Phase 1: Measurement Infrastructure** (Already in Top 5 Impact)
- Build reproducible benchmark suite
- Measure baseline performance
- Identify bottlenecks with profiling

**Phase 2: Deep Dive Analysis** (Research)
- **SAF IPC Overhead Analysis**
  - Compare DocumentFile vs. direct File API performance
  - Measure per-operation costs (listFiles, openInputStream, metadata)
  - Identify if batching/caching can reduce IPC calls

- **Encoding Detection Profiling**
  - Measure UniversalDetector performance on various file types
  - UTF-8 dominance in modern files - can we skip detection more often?
  - Compare: detect-always vs. extension-based skip vs. BOM-only detection

- **Pattern Matching Optimization**
  - Regex compilation overhead
  - Boyer-Moore string search for literal patterns
  - Compare Java Pattern vs. native code (JNI grep port?)

- **Memory vs. Speed Tradeoffs**
  - In-memory result caching
  - Streaming vs. buffered file reading
  - Parallel file processing (thread pool sizing)

**Research Questions**:
1. Is SAF IPC overhead the #1 bottleneck? (Hypothesis: yes)
2. Can we predict encoding from file metadata to skip detection?
3. Would native C/C++ grep port be faster than Java Pattern?
4. What's the optimal thread pool size for parallel file processing?
5. Does caching directory listings help repeated searches?

**Potential Optimizations** (After Measurement):
- Directory listing cache with LRU eviction
- Parallel file processing (multi-threaded search)
- Native regex engine via JNI
- Smarter encoding detection (BOM-first, then detect)
- Batch SAF queries using DocumentsContract

**Why Important**:
- SAF migration already caused performance regression
- Need data-driven optimization, not guesswork
- Could contribute findings to Android community

**Free vs. Paid**:
- Optimization benefits should be in free version (quality baseline)
- Paid version could have "Performance Mode" with aggressive optimizations

### 5. Advanced Search Modes

**Impact**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Medium - power user features)
**Effort**: üî®üî®üî® to üî®üî®üî®üî® (6-15 hours depending on mode)
**Status**: **FUTURE** - Power user features
**Paid Version**: Could bundle as "Advanced Search Pack"

**Potential Modes**:

1. **Multiline / Cross-Line Search**
   - Requested by Japanese users
   - Search patterns that span multiple lines
   - Regex with DOTALL flag: `.` matches newlines
   - UI: Checkbox "Multiline mode"
   - Example: Find XML tags spanning lines

2. **Context Lines (Before/After)**
   - Like `grep -A 2 -B 2`
   - Show N lines before and after match
   - UI: Spinner "Show context: [0] [1] [2] [5] lines"
   - Improves match understanding

3. **Inverse Matching**
   - Like `grep -v`
   - Find files that DON'T contain pattern
   - UI: Checkbox "Invert match (exclude)"
   - Use case: Find files without certain text

4. **Line Number Range Filtering**
   - Search only lines 10-100
   - UI: Optional "Line range: [start] to [end]"
   - Use case: Search specific sections of large files

5. **Binary File Handling**
   - Currently may try to search binary files
   - Add: "Skip binary files" option
   - Detect binary via null bytes or magic numbers

**Monetization**:
- Free: Basic search modes
- Paid: Advanced modes (multiline, context, inverse)

   - Summary view: files with match counts only

4. **Secondary Search within Results**
   - Search-within-search: filter results by another pattern
   - Example: Search for "error", then filter to "database" errors
   - UI: Secondary search field in results screen

5. **Result Highlighting & Annotation**
   - Different colors for different match groups
   - User annotations on results
   - Star/flag important results

**Monetization**:
- Free: Basic results display
- Paid: Advanced filtering, annotations, saved result sets

**Impact**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Low-Medium - encoding detection already works)
**Effort**: üî®üî®üî®üî®üî® (20+ hours)
**Status**: **EXPERIMENTAL** - Academic interest only

**What**: Use ML to predict file encoding faster/better than UniversalDetector

**Why Experimental**:
- UniversalDetector already works well
- ML adds complexity and model size
- UTF-8 dominates modern files - benefit minimal
- Academic interest > practical value

**Research Value**:
- Explore lightweight on-device ML
- Could publish as academic case study

---

### 8. Distributed/Cloud Search

**Impact**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Low - niche use case)
**Effort**: üî®üî®üî®üî®üî® (30+ hours)
**Status**: **OUT OF SCOPE** - Too complex

**What**: Search files on remote servers or cloud storage

**Why Out of Scope**:
- Network latency kills performance
- Security/authentication complexity
